Technical Task: Java developer
We are eager to get to know your code style. Please find below the instructions for a quick but interesting example helping us to see how you handle the full potential that the JDK offers.
Hence, please stick to the JDK and avoid using any other open source libraries. It is important to us to understand how and why you get to a solution (i.e., your code style).
