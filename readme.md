# WebCrawlApp

## Assignment

Technical Task: Java developer
We are eager to get to know your code style. Please find below the instructions for a quick but interesting example helping us to see how you handle the full potential that the JDK offers.
Hence, please stick to the JDK and avoid using any other open source libraries. It is important to us to understand how and why you get to a solution (i.e., your code style).

- [x] Connect to an arbitrary website (http/s)
- [x] Search for all links on this site referring to other pages of the same domain (website) and collect them
- [x] for each collected link start over with (1) -
- [x] we would like to see some multithreading here since network tends to be slow
- [x] When finished, output the full collection of links sorted by the link label

Result: collection of links for an arbitrary website (e.g., orf.at, ecosio.com)
In order to share your code with us, please upload the task in your own github or gitlab account and then share it with us.

## Make it work

This is a command line application. At the beginning there is a prompt to type your favourite URL to crawl through. If you do not feel like it, you can even hit enter, there is a default starting point set up.
